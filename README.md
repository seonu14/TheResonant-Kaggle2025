# The Resonant ‚Äì Red-Teaming Challenge Submission

## üîç Overview

This repository contains the full writeup for **"The Resonant"**, a red-teaming investigation submitted to the Kaggle Red Teaming Challenge. The project explores how large language models‚Äîspecifically `gpt-oss-20b`‚Äîexhibit structural reasoning flaws under layered ethical, symbolic, and systemic pressures.

Rather than focusing on content correctness, this analysis examines *when, how, and why* the model‚Äôs judgment crystallizes prematurely, trading ambiguity for rhetorical polish. Five scenarios (A‚ÄìE) were used to probe different dimensions of model reasoning.

## üìö Full Report

The full writeup is available in this repository:  
**üëâ [`TheResonant_Report_KaggleReady.html`](./TheResonant_Report_KaggleReady.html)**  
It is also [viewable on GitHub](https://github.com/seonu14/TheResonant-Kaggle2025).

This report includes:
- Introduction to framing failure in LLMs  
- Detailed analyses of five scenario types (health, ethics, legality, systems, civic)  
- Cross-scenario synthesis (convergence, divergence, propagation)  
- Strategic recommendations for model design, deployment, and governance

## üì¶ Files submitted

- `TheResonant_Submission.zip`  
  ‚Äì Includes the five JSON scenario findings and README.

- `TheResonant_ReproToolkit.zip`  
  ‚Äì Contains reproducible notebooks, the mock runner, and evaluation toolkit.

- `TheResonant_Report_KaggleReady.html`  
  ‚Äì Full writeup with scenario analyses, cross-scenario synthesis, and strategic recommendations.

Please note:  
`TheResonant_ReproToolkit.zip` reflects the current stabilized structure of the toolkit.  
Minor updates may occur before submission, but the core format is expected to remain consistent.

## ‚ú® Highlighted Insight

> "The model didn‚Äôt fail through error, but through elegant finality."

Each scenario reflects a different way that model fluency can mask epistemic shallowness or ethical shortcuts‚Äîespecially when under symbolic or emotional pressure.

## üîÅ Cross-Scenario Summary

| Scenario | Input Pressure       | Collapse Type         | Closure Arc            | Missed Tension             |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **A**    | Allocative + Moral   | Policy Lock-in         | Simplicity ‚Üí Structure | Overlapping vulnerability  |
| **B**    | Emotional            | Moral Justification    | Betrayal ‚Üí Duty        | Alternative restraint      |
| **C**    | Legal + Emotional    | Instruction as Verdict | Collapse ‚Üí Command     | Emotional hesitation       |
| **D**    | Time-Critical        | Cascade Blindness      | Immediacy ‚Üí Blindness  | Cross-system fragility     |
| **E**    | Symbolic + Civic     | Therapeutic Exit Bias  | Guilt ‚Üí Healing        | Collective cost            |

## üß≠ Methodology

Each scenario was intentionally structured with escalating prompts to simulate real-world ethical ambiguity, time pressure, or symbolic tension. Model behavior was logged at each stage and evaluated based on judgment formation trajectory‚Äînot just correctness.

All runs used `gpt-oss-20b` at temperature 0.7 and top_p 0.9.

Its goal is not only to report findings, but to offer methodological approaches for surfacing hidden risks and structural failure modes in LLMs.
