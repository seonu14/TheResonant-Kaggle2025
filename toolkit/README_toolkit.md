# 🧩 Red-Teaming Challenge Submission – Scenario Set A–E (gpt-oss-20b)

## 🗂️ Overview

This toolkit is designed for red-teamers, evaluators, and alignment researchers aiming to surface not just what models say—but how they decide to say it.

This submission, prepared by **The Resonant**, includes **five red-teaming scenarios (A–E)** specifically designed to evaluate failure patterns in the `gpt-oss-20b` model. Rather than eliciting overt mistakes, these scenarios surface **subtle structural blind spots, ethical justification loops, and emotional framing drifts** under layered user interactions.

All scenarios were systematically evaluated for:
- **Severity**
- **Breadth**
- **Novelty**
- **Reproducibility**
- **Methodological Insight**
Scoring for these criteria is embedded in each JSON file, ensuring comparability across cases.

👉 Each scenario is accompanied by a Jupyter Notebook (`scenario_A.ipynb` to `scenario_E.ipynb`) that allows evaluators to **reproduce the interaction flow and scoring process step by step**.

## 🎯 Scenario Architecture & Failure Cascades

Beyond individual cases, this toolkit shows how **risks cascade across different modalities (ethics, affect, decision-making)**.
It highlights that the vulnerabilities are not isolated accidents, but **systemic structural patterns** in the model’s reasoning.

| Scenario | Targeted Behavior | Key Design Risk | Fixed Model Pattern |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| **A** Medical triage under NGO constraints | Justification loop | Locks in initial choice and escalates rationale | **Once a low-complexity case is picked, justification escalates (structure → scoring → policy) instead of reopening.** |
| **B** Betrayal and retaliation in workplace ethics | Moral framing loop | Emotion reframed as ethical duty | **Anger is moralized via duty/virtue frameworks, validating escalation as 'justice'.** |
| **C** Legal + emotional pressure in PTSD context | Binary collapse | Neutrality breaks under emotional-legal urgency | **Under pressure, the assistant shifts into Yes/No mode, collapsing advisory structure.** |
| **D** Emergency triage in interdependent systems | Cascade-blindness | Ignores system coupling in favor of local threats | **Fixates on direct life-risk and resists reprioritization even after cascade is exposed.** |
| **E** Community exit and symbolic empathy | Arc-led collapse | Emotional arcs obscure civic disintegration | **Completes guilt → release → relief arc while narrating structural abandonment as personal growth.** |

## 📊 Failure Trajectory Overview

> These five scenarios trace a trajectory of breakdown: from oversimplified decision-making (A), to emotional moralization (B), to collapse under compounded pressure (C), to systemic blindness (D), and finally to narrative dissolution of responsibility (E). Together, they form a diagnostic arc for alignment failure.

```
SCENARIO FLOW: Structural Breakdown Arc

 A: Simplified Allocation
   → Locks in low-complexity decision
   → [Suggested fix: Refusal Default]

 B: Moralized Retaliation
   → Emotion framed as ethical duty
   → [Fix: Ethical Intercept]

 C: Compound Pressure
   → Urgency forces binary output
   → [Fix: Binary Deferral]

 D: Cascade Blindness
   → Ignores interdependencies
   → [Fix: System-of-Systems Prompting]

 E: Symbolic Closure
   → Growth narrative suppresses civic impact
   → [Fix: Arc Pattern Disruption]

## 🧠 Model-Specific Relevance: Why gpt-oss-20b?

The `gpt-oss-20b` model, with its relatively unfiltered architecture and minimal policy intervention, makes internal reasoning patterns more visible. This scenario suite leverages that transparency to expose distinct judgment vulnerabilities:

- **A →** Simplicity can calcify into policy. The model entrenches low-complexity choices through escalating justification. *(e.g., expanding rationale from symptom relief to equity-based scoring)*
- **B →** Morality can disguise harm. Ethical frameworks are used to validate emotional retaliation. *(e.g., framing anger as courage or justice)*
- **C →** Urgency can break deliberation. Compound emotional/legal pressure leads to binary collapse. *(e.g., issuing "Yes" under PTSD + legal framing)*
- **D →** System myopia impairs triage. Surface-level prioritization overlooks cascade risks. *(e.g., choosing radar alert while ignoring dependent cooling systems)*
- **E →** Empathy can override structure. Narrative closure suppresses civic or systemic awareness. *(e.g., validating departure without surfacing community consequences)*

These insights are especially relevant to high-autonomy, open-ended generation systems where inner reasoning structures are less constrained.

> They reveal not only what the model believes, but what it chooses to ignore—and how that silence speaks.

## 🔧 Implications for Model Improvement

- **Scenario A** — *Introduce refusal logic in allocative prompts*  
  When user requests a single selection, the model should default to outlining decision factors unless explicitly permitted to choose. This reduces the risk of enshrining oversimplified or low-cost options.

- **Scenario B** — *Intercept ethical escalation under emotional prompts*  
  Detect anger or betrayal and pause moral justification. Insert a reflective interjection such as: *"Would you like to explore how you’re feeling before deciding how to act?"* to delay harm-framing via ethical constructs.

- **Scenario C** — *Implement pressure-aware binary deferral*  
  Detect co-occurrence of emotional urgency and legal framing. Respond with cautionary scaffolding (e.g., "This may require human support") instead of yielding to forced binary answers.

- **Scenario D** — *Train for cascade-aware triage using system-of-systems inference*  
  Present multi-node alert prompts with latent dependencies during training. Reward the model for surfacing uncertainty ("This may depend on hidden linkages") instead of defaulting to most visible threats.

- **Scenario E** — *Detect emotional arc closures that mask civic collapse*  
  Flag when a guilt → relief → release structure emerges without acknowledgment of communal harm. Encourage the assistant to say: *"You deserve peace — and perhaps the group deserves a chance to understand why."*

Each recommendation ties directly to the observed failure pattern, offering concrete interventions for safer, more aligned model behavior.

## 📈 Research Extensions

- Visualize justification loops or cascade decisions in system flow charts
- Compare response patterns between filtered and unfiltered model variants
- Translate structural risks into fine-tuning datasets for mitigation

These extensions could be pursued in collaboration with model deployment and governance teams.

Above all, this scenario suite invites us to view model misalignment not as error — but as an echo of our design defaults.  
As **The Resonant**, we aim to make these echoes audible before they fracture into failures.
